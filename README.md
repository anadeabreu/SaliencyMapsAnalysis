# SaliencyMapsAnalysis

## General description

## Content

This folder contains the following jupyter notebook files:

(1) ParsingStats_DBSCAN.ipynb -- Process the csv file into saliency maps. In addition, data is studied through visualizations.  
(2) ScanPaths.ipynb -- Data visualization: Plots user scan path on top of the studied image.  
(3) ContourPlot.ipynb -- Data visualization: Plots a contour graph of the fixations distribution.  
(4) StandardDeviationModel.ipynb -- Distortion due to spherical to planar projection (Proof-of-concept).  
(5) ComparingSaliencyMaps.ipynb -- Evaluates the performance of a modeled saliency map, using ROC, NSS and correlation.  

## Getting started

Each file is an independent code. Note that the different paths need to be modified. Jupyter notebook need to be installed
